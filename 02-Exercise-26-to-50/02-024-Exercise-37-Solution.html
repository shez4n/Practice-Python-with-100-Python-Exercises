Please take into consideration that a comma can separate some words with no space. For example, "<em>Hi, it's me."</em>&nbsp;would need to be counted&nbsp;as three words. For your convenience, you can use the text file in the attachment.</p><p><strong>Answer 1:&nbsp;</strong></p><pre class="prettyprint linenums">def count_words(filepath):
    with open(filepath, 'r') as file:
        text = file.read()
    text = text.replace(",", " ")
    string_list = text.split(" ")
    return len(string_list)

print(count_words("words2.txt"))</pre><p><strong>Explanation 1</strong>:<br></p><p>This solution is like the previous exercise's solution with the difference that before splitting, we are replacing all commas with a space that will let the split method count the number of words.</p><p><strong>Answer 2:&nbsp;</strong></p><pre class="prettyprint linenums">import re

def count_words_re(filepath):
    with open(filepath, 'r') as file:
        text = file.read()
    string_list = re.split(",| ", text)
    return len(string_list)

print(count_words_re("words2.txt"))
</pre><p><strong>Explanation 2</strong>:</p><p>This alternative solution uses the built-in <code>re</code>&nbsp; module, which provides regular expression matching operations. We're using the split method of that module, and the expression <code>",| "</code>&nbsp;is meant to&nbsp;replace commas&nbsp;with spaces. Using methods from the&nbsp;<code>re</code>&nbsp; module can be more appropriate than Python built-in methods when string operations are complicated. However, for this simple scenario, the <code>re </code>&nbsp;module could be skipped.</p>
