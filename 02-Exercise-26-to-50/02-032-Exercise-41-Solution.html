with open("letters.txt", "w") as file:

</pre><p><strong>Explanation</strong>:</p><p>The <code>ascii_lowercase </code>&nbsp; property&nbsp;of the <code>string </code>&nbsp;module is quite helpful here to generate a string of all letters. Then we create a file, and while the file is open, we iterate through the string and apply the write method in each iteration to write the letters in the text file. We are also&nbsp;appending <code>\n</code>&nbsp; to each letter, which is a special character that creates break lines. That makes sure to separate the letters in different lines.</p>
