</pre><p><strong>Explanation 1</strong>:</p><p>As you can&nbsp;see, we applied an <code>int </code>&nbsp;function to the <code>input </code>&nbsp;function.

age_last_year = int(age) - 1
print("Last year you were %s." % age_last_year)
</pre><p><strong>Explanation 2</strong>:</p><p>In this alternative solution, we applied the <code>int </code>&nbsp;function in the line where the math operation occurs. This could be useful if you intend to use the user input value as a string in other parts of your script, so you don't want to convert it to an integer directly.</p>
