Please fix it so that the expected output is printed out.</p><pre class="prettyprint linenums">firstname = input("Enter first name: ")
secondname = input("Enter second name: ")
print("Your first name is %s and your second name is %s" % firstname, secondname)</pre><p><strong>Answer:&nbsp;</strong><br></p><pre class="prettyprint linenums">firstname = input("Enter first name: ")
secondname = input("Enter second name: ")
print("Your first name is %s and your second name is %s" % (firstname, secondname))
</pre><p><strong>Explanation</strong>:</p><p>Each of the <code>%s</code>&nbsp; placeholders expect one value after <code>%</code>&nbsp; to be replaced with, but you need to pass these values inside a tuple. So, putting variables <code>firstname </code>&nbsp;and <code>secondname </code>&nbsp;inside a tuple fixes the code.</p>
