print(vocabulary(word))
</pre><p><strong>Explanation</strong>:</p><p>It's good to create a function as the above code shows&nbsp;so that the code is more organized in case you need to expand it&nbsp;and add more features&nbsp;later.&nbsp;</p><p>The function gets the word string from the <code>input</code>&nbsp; function,&nbsp;queries the dictionary and prints out the result. Of course, we are forced to use only the words we have in the dictionary. If you want to make this a more real-life translator, you would need a complete dictionary, and you would also want to store it in a file instead of keeping it inside the script.&nbsp;</p>
