Make sure the file has that name exactly. </p><p>Then paste the following code in the file (manually)</p><pre class="prettyprint linenums">import requests

headers = {'User-agent': 'Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Ubuntu; Linux x86_64; rv:61.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/61.0'}
r = requests.get("http://www.pythonhow.com", headers = headers)
print(r.text[:100])</pre><p>Executing the script will throw an error. Please fix that error so that you get the expected output and&nbsp;explain why the error happened.</p><p><strong>Answer:&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Rename the file name from <code>requests.py</code>&nbsp; to something else.</p><p><strong>Explanation</strong>:</p><p>In the code,&nbsp;Python is actually referring to the script name, which is <code>requests </code>&nbsp;And it doesn't find a get attribute for that name. Script names load in the current namespace. They are actually stored in the<code> __name__</code>&nbsp; variable. You could try to print that variable out, and you would see that it prints your script name.&nbsp;Therefore you should not name your scripts under library names.&nbsp;</p>
