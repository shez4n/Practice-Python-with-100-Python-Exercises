Please make sure you generate the current year dynamically.</p><p><strong>Answer:&nbsp;</strong></p><pre class="prettyprint linenums">from datetime import datetime

age = int(input("What's your age? "))
year_birth = datetime.now().year - age
print("We think you were born back in %s" % year_birth)
</pre><p><strong>Explanation</strong>:</p><p>We're getting user input, and we are converting&nbsp;it to an integer since <code>input </code>&nbsp;loads everything as a string. Then we produce the current year dynamically with <code>datetime.now().year</code>&nbsp; And we subtract the age from that to find out the year of birth. Lastly, in line 5, we use string formatting to produce a string with the year inside it.</p><p><br></p>
