If the conditions are met, print out the reason why pointing to the specific condition/s&nbsp;that has not been satisfied.</p><p><strong>Answer:&nbsp;</strong></p><pre class="prettyprint linenums">while True:
    notes = []
    psw = input("Enter password: ")
    if not any(i.isdigit() for i in psw):
        notes.append("You need at least one number")
    if not any(i.isupper() for i in psw):
        notes.append("You need at least one uppercase letter")
    if len(psw) &lt; 5:
        notes.append("You need at least 5 characters")
    if len(notes) == 0:
        print("Password is fine")
        break
    else:
        print("Please check the following: ")
        for note in notes:
            print(note)
</pre><p><strong>Explanation</strong>:</p><p>Again, we're using a&nbsp;<code>while</code>&nbsp;loop. In the first <code>if</code>&nbsp; condition, we check if there is any number in the submitted password, and if there is, we append a message string to the <code>notes</code>&nbsp; list. Then, we check the next conditions in the next two <code>if</code>&nbsp; conditionals and keep adding messages to <code>notes</code>&nbsp;. We also check if the length of <code>notes</code>&nbsp; is zero because it if is, that means there was no message added there, which means the password is fine. Lastly, under <code>else</code>&nbsp;, we iterate through the constructed list and print out its items (i.e.,&nbsp;messages).</p>
