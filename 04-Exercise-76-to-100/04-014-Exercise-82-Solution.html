</pre><p><strong>Explanation</strong>:</p><p>This solution required some internet research to find out about the&nbsp;<code>ephem</code>&nbsp; library, which is used for astronomy computations. The library can be installed with <code>pip install ephem</code>But if that doesn't work on Windows, then&nbsp;download a precompiled version from <a href="http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#pyephem" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">here</a> and install it again with pip like <code>pip install ephem3.7.6.0cp36cp36mwin_amd64.whl</code>&nbsp;</p><p>In the ephem <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/ephem/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">webpage</a>, you can find an example to start. The above solution was developed based on that example.&nbsp;</p>
