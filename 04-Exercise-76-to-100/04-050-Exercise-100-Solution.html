The app then checks if the username exists in a text file, and it also checks if the password contains at least one number, one uppercase letter, and it is at least 5 characters long.</p><p><strong>Answer:&nbsp;</strong></p><p><em>Please find the code attached in the resources tab.&nbsp;</em></p><p><strong>Explanation</strong>:</p><p>We have two while loops here, which we got from exercise 81. The difference is instead of getting input through an input function; we're getting input from the html form with&nbsp;<code>usr = request.form['username']</code>&nbsp;. If that user exists in the text file, we insert the message "<em>Username exists</em>" in the HTML page, and we render the HTML form again. The same goes for the password.</p>
