<p>Congratulations on completing the course! To get an idea of your skill level, please refer to the following chart:</p><p><em>Points</em>:&nbsp;0 - 75<br><em>Skill Level</em>: Beginner<br><em>Description</em>:&nbsp;If your score falls in this range, that means you still have a lot of work to do. If you scored at least 30, that could mean you know what loops, functions, integers, and other elements of the language are, but you need to practice them to be able to use them comfortably. If you scored near 75, that could mean you can create simple Python programs, but you've to work some more to understand and solve more complex issues.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><em>Points</em>:&nbsp;76 - 150<br><em>Level</em>: Intermediate<br><em>Description</em>: Python basics are not a problem for you, and you are on the right track to becoming an advanced programmer. You can understand and solve complex problems but still have some gaps with some aspects of Python.&nbsp;In case&nbsp;you scored near 150, you can probably get an entry-level Python programming&nbsp;job.</p><p><br></p><p><em>Points</em>:&nbsp;151 - 224<br><em>Level</em>:&nbsp;Advanced<br><em>Description</em>:&nbsp;If your score falls in this range, that means you&nbsp;can&nbsp;program independently and solve&nbsp;complex Python problems. It also means you can&nbsp;get a job as a Python programmer with not much effort. Congratulations!</p>
